# RbxStu V3

This is the source, unedited and uncompromised of the now discontinued Roblox Studio pentesting tool. RbxStu V3.

This project contains comprehensive comments, function names, design and other aspects on how to make an exploit for Roblox Studio. You may use it as you like, as unlike RbxStu V2, this source is licensed into the public domain.

This is my last project involving Roblox Exploitation. I will not be making a V4, I believe V3 obtained its objective, being a comprehensive, stable and useful pentesting tool for the time it lasted, albeit short for my standards, it is much better than anything I could've designed when I first started.

It taught me how to design and program software in a correct and (mostly maintainable) manner.

I would also like to thank the unseen contributors who helped me during development!

Unseen contributors:
- Pixeluted (Helped me with maintaining/development)
- Joe (Taught me the very basics)
- MakeSureDudeDies and landervander (Inspired me for DX11 bs)
- lonegladiator (gladhaxx is a great resource)
- senS (Helped test the environment of V3)

The aforementioned list of contributors provided significant and sufficient value to me on my way to develop this project, and while it may not be perfect, it has certainly forever changed the way I thinkk about software, programming and exploiting in general.

Cheers to all contributors!
